# LAB3: Linear Regression and Predictive Modeling

## Overview
This lab explores the fundamentals of linear regression, applying both simple and multiple regression techniques to real-world datasets. The exercises cover the full machine learning workflow: data exploration, model training, evaluation, and interpretation.

### 1. Simple Linear Regression: Student Scores (`student_scores.csv`)
- Predicted student exam scores based on hours studied.
- Explored the dataset, visualized the relationship, and confirmed linearity.
- Split the data into training and test sets, trained a linear regression model, and evaluated performance using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R-squared.
- Visualized model fit and residuals to assess accuracy and potential overfitting.

### 2. Multiple Linear Regression: Boston Housing (`HousingData.csv`)
- Predicted Boston house prices using multiple features from the classic housing dataset.
- Explored feature correlations, selected highly correlated predictors, and visualized relationships with 3D plots.
- Normalized features and trained models using both LinearRegression and SGDRegressor from scikit-learn.
- Compared learning rates and convergence behaviors, visualized loss curves, and selected the best model based on evaluation metrics.
- Interpreted model results and visualized predictions in 3D.

## Key Takeaways
- Developed a strong understanding of both simple and multiple linear regression.
- Practiced the end-to-end ML workflow: data prep, modeling, evaluation, and visualization.
- Learned to interpret regression metrics and diagnose model performance.
- Gained experience with scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, and model selection strategies.

## Why This Matters
Linear regression is a foundational technique in machine learning. This lab demonstrates my ability to apply regression to real data, interpret results, and communicate findingsâ€”key skills for any aspiring data scientist.
