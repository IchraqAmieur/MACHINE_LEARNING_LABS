# LAB2: Data Cleaning, Visualization, and Preprocessing for Machine Learning

## Overview
This lab focuses on the critical steps of preparing real-world data for machine learning. Using the Hepatitis dataset, I explored data visualization, cleaning, outlier detection, feature selection, and data splittingâ€”laying a strong foundation for robust ML modeling.

### 1. Data Visualization and Exploration (`TP2V2.ipynb`)
- Loaded and explored the Hepatitis dataset, examining the first, last, and random samples.
- Analyzed dataset structure, feature types, and summary statistics.
- Visualized distributions and relationships using line plots, histograms, and box plots.
- Checked dataset balance and discussed the importance of visualization for identifying trends and outliers.

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Identified and handled missing values using various strategies: dropping, imputing with mean/mode, and analyzing the impact of each method.
- Discussed the importance of clean data for accurate ML results.

### 3. Outlier Detection and Handling
- Used box plots and the Interquartile Range (IQR) to detect outliers in key features.
- Applied automatic methods to handle outliers, ensuring data quality and model reliability.

### 4. Feature Selection and Correlation Analysis
- Explored feature correlations using Pearson heatmaps.
- Selected features with strong correlation to the target variable and removed redundant or highly correlated features.
- Discussed why feature selection is crucial for reducing overfitting and improving model performance.

### 5. Data Splitting
- Split the dataset into training and test sets using both hold-out and stratified hold-out strategies.
- Compared class distributions in each split to ensure fair evaluation.

## Key Takeaways
- Mastered essential preprocessing steps: cleaning, visualization, outlier handling, and feature selection.
- Understood the impact of data quality on machine learning outcomes.
- Practiced using pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn for real-world data preparation.

## Why This Matters
Effective data preprocessing is the backbone of successful machine learning. This lab demonstrates my ability to transform raw data into a reliable foundation for building accurate and generalizable models.
