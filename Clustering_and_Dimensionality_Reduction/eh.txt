For example, if your cluster labels are:


kmeans_standard_labels = [2, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2]
And you're processing cluster = 2, then:


mask = [True, False, False, True, False, False, True]
2. trainy[mask]
Selects the true labels (trainy) for the points in the current cluster.

For example, if trainy = [0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0] and the above mask is applied:

trainy[mask] = [0, 0, 0]
These are the true labels of the points in cluster 2.

3. mode(trainy[mask]).mode[0]
Finds the most frequent true label (mode) in the current cluster.

trainy[mask] = [0, 0, 0]
mode(trainy[mask]).mode[0] = 0
Here, the most common true label is 0.

4. aligned_labels[mask] = mode(trainy[mask]).mode[0]
Replaces the cluster label with the most frequent true label for all points in the current cluster.

For example: If mask = [True, False, False, True, False, False, True], then:

aligned_labels[mask] = 0
Now, all points in cluster 2 will be labeled as 0 (the most frequent true label).
