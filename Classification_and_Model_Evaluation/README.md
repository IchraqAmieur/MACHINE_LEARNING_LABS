# LAB4: Classification Algorithms and Model Evaluation

## Overview
This lab focuses on supervised classification using the Heart Disease Detection dataset. The exercises cover the full pipeline: data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and interpretation using multiple algorithms.

### 1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing
- Explored the heart disease dataset, understood feature meanings, and checked for missing values.
- Visualized class distribution to assess dataset balance.
- Applied dummy encoding to categorical features and normalized data using z-score scaling.
- Analyzed feature correlations with the target and among predictors.

### 2. Model Training and Evaluation
- Trained several classification algorithms: Gaussian Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (K=3), Decision Tree (max_depth=6), and implemented SVM from scratch.
- Visualized and saved the decision tree structure.
- Evaluated models using classification reports, confusion matrices, and ROC curves.
- Compared models and selected the best based on relevant metrics.
- Performed cross-validation on the top model for robust assessment.

### 3. Insights and Recommendations
- Discussed the importance of feature scaling, encoding, and balanced evaluation metrics for medical datasets.
- Recommended the most suitable evaluation metric for this classification task.
- Demonstrated prediction on new samples and interpreted model results.

## Key Takeaways
- Mastered the end-to-end classification workflow: preprocessing, modeling, evaluation, and interpretation.
- Gained experience with scikit-learn, pandas, and custom SVM implementation.
- Developed skills in model comparison and metric selection for real-world problems.

## Why This Matters
Classification is a core task in machine learning, especially in healthcare. This lab demonstrates my ability to build, evaluate, and interpret classification models, preparing me for advanced ML and AI applications.
