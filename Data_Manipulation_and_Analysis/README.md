# LAB1: Foundations of Data Manipulation and Real-World Analysis

## Overview
This lab introduces essential skills in data manipulation using Python, focusing on both synthetic and real-world datasets. It is divided into two main parts:

### 1. Numpy and Matrix Operations (`tp1.ipynb`)
- Practiced creating and reshaping arrays with NumPy.
- Performed matrix multiplication and basic slicing to extract rows and columns.
- Visualized data using matplotlib, reinforcing understanding of Python's scientific stack.
- Gained hands-on experience with core operations that underpin machine learning workflows.

### 2. Data Analysis: Impact of Remote Work on Mental Health (`remote.ipynb`)
- Explored a real dataset (`Impact_of_Remote_Work_on_Mental_Health.csv`) with 5,000 entries and 20 features, including demographics, work habits, and mental health indicators.
- Loaded and inspected the data using pandas, checking for missing values and understanding the structure.
- Analyzed key variables such as stress level, work-life balance, and satisfaction with remote work.
- Practiced data cleaning and exploratory analysis, preparing for deeper insights in future labs.

## Key Takeaways
- Developed proficiency in NumPy for mathematical operations and data structuring.
- Built confidence in handling real-world datasets with pandas.
- Understood the importance of data exploration before modeling.
- Connected technical skills to relevant, real-life issues in the workplace.

## Why This Matters
This lab lays the groundwork for advanced machine learning by ensuring a strong grasp of data manipulation and analysis. The combination of synthetic exercises and real-world data prepares me to tackle practical ML problems with confidence.
